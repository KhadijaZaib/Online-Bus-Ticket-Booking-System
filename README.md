# Online-Bus-Ticket-Booking-System
This project is an Online Bus Ticket Booking System developed in C++ as part of my 1st semester BSCS course. It allows users to view available buses, check seat availability, book tickets, and manage reservations. The system uses basic concepts of C++ programming, ensuring simple, efficient, and user-friendly ticket booking.
